Hello and welcome to this assignment overview for Database Backup and Restoration. This video will guide you through the assignment, including using the MySQL command-line interface CLI to generate a backup of the database, creating a data loss scenario, and restoring the database with MySQL CLI and phpMyAdmin. You will begin by utilizing the MySQL CLI to generate a backup of the database. This backup file, named salesbackup.sql, will encompass both the schema and the transactional data. After creating the backup, you will review the file to confirm it contains all the required information. Next, you'll create a data loss scenario to reflect real-world challenges. For this, you will delete critical records and drop a table from the database. This will help illustrate the consequences of unintentional data loss in an OLTP system. 
To recover from the simulated data loss, you will recover the database through two distinct methods. First, you'll perform the restoration using the MySQL CLI, executing the operation with the backup file and verifying the results by running queries on the database. Next, you'll repeat the process using the phpMyAdmin interface for comparison. In phpMyAdmin, you'll set up a new database named sales underscore restored and import the backup file. Finally, you'll validate the recovery by ensuring that all the tables are fully restored. Throughout the assignment, you will document your progress by taking screenshots of the backup process, the simulated data loss, and the successful restoration of both methods. These steps will demonstrate your ability to safeguard and recover critical transactional data effectively. 
Good luck and let's get started!
