Hello, and welcome to this assignment overview for Backup and Restore Automation. This video will guide you through the assignment, including how to automate the backup and restore processes for MySQL databases using phpMyAdmin and cron jobs. You'll also ensure the data is securely backed up and can be restored efficiently, without manual intervention. You will automate the process of backup and restore by writing a shell script that uses MySQL CLI to create a backup of the sales database. The script will save the backup file to a specified directory and append a timestamp to the filename for easy identification. Once the script is ready, you will schedule it to run automatically at regular intervals using cron jobs. You'll configure the cron job to run the backup script daily, weekly, or as needed, ensuring that the backup process happens without requiring manual input. 
Throughout the assignment, you will document the shell scripts created for both the backup and restore processes, along with testing them to ensure that the automation works correctly. Additionally, you'll capture screenshots of the cron job settings to verify that the backup and restore processes are scheduled to run automatically. Good luck and let's get started!
