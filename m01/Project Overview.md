Project Overview
Estimated time needed: 15 minutes

Introduction
Imagine you are a database administrator at XYZ Data Solutions, tasked with designing and implementing strategies for data administration and management for a growing e-commerce company.

Your goal is to build a robust system that includes:

Creating an OLTP database and setting up a data warehouse
Creating automated ETL pipelines
Setting up automated backup and restore capabilities for the database
Implementing data security protocols and optimizing query performance
The approach
In this capstone project, you will systematically address each stage of the data solution's lifecycle. You'll begin by designing an OLTP database and building a data warehouse to accommodate both transactional and analytical needs. Next, you'll develop ETL pipelines and automate them with Apache Airflow to ensure consistent, reliable data flow.

You'll then implement backup and restore strategies, applying best practices for database backup and recovery to safeguard against data loss. Additionally, you'll automate backup and restore tasks to enhance operational efficiency, reducing manual overhead and minimizing downtime.

Next, your focus will shift to optimizing SQL queries for better performance, implementing robust security and data encryption strategies. You'll define user roles and permissions to protect sensitive information. You'll also apply advanced query optimization techniques, ensuring that your database remains both efficient and secure.

Finally, you'll bring all these components together in your Final Project submission, delivering a scalable, resilient, and comprehensive solution that meets the evolving needs of the e-commerce environment.

This project is designed to apply the concepts and skills you've acquired in the following program:

IBM Relational Database Administration Professional Certificate
Key guiding resources
Assignments (hands-on Labs): Each module includes one or more assignments designed to guide you in building a relational database solution from the ground up.

Deliverables: These assignments serve as key deliverables, contributing directly to your Final Project.

Videos: Each assignment is preceded by an overview video, offering valuable insights into what to expect and how to approach the task.

Checklists: They ensure that you are firmly on the path to successful project completion.

Documentation: You will be instructed to take screenshots or save code as text. These are helpful and will help you answer the questions in the Graded Quizzes and Final Project.

Modules and tasks overview
Module 1: Data Platform Architecture and OLTP Database

Design and implement an OLTP database schema to store and manage transactional data effectively.
Establish the foundation for the data platform by validating data insertion and automating administrative tasks.
Module 2: Build a Data Warehouse

Create a data warehouse with multiple tables and establish schema-based relationships between them.
Enable data analysis by querying individual and grouped tables for comprehensive reporting.
Module 3: ETL and Data Pipelines

Develop ETL pipelines to extract, transform, and load data from various sources into the data warehouse
Automate ETL workflows using Apache Airflow to ensure consistent and reliable data integration
Module 4: Backup, Restore, and Automation

Implement backup and restore strategies to safeguard the database against data loss.
Automate repetitive database tasks to streamline operations and maintain system efficiency.
Module 5: Database Optimization, Security, and Access Management

Optimize SQL queries and resolve common database issues to improve overall system performance.
Manage user roles and permissions to ensure secure and controlled access to the database.
Module 6: Final Project submission

Submission and evaluation of the final project.
Tools and technologies
MySQL: To design the OLTP database and create data storage.
pgAdmin: To design and manage data warehouses using PostgreSQL.
Apache Airflow: To schedule and monitor workflows for data pipelines.
Python: To configure and define DAG operations.
Bash: To write scripts that automate tasks, such as exporting data.
PostgreSQL: To manage data warehouses and execute complex queries.
IDE: For example, Cloud IDE to develop code and test your database's functionality.
Evaluation criteria
The capstone project is divided into modules, each containing specific deliverables. Your final project will be evaluated based on the following key aspects:

Adherence to guidelines and instructions
Quality of implementation for each database feature
Creativity and problem-solving in designing database functionality
Completeness and clarity of the database solution
Next steps
Before you begin, revisit the concepts and skills from previous courses in this program. Carefully plan your project and prepare a timeline to manage your work efficiently.
