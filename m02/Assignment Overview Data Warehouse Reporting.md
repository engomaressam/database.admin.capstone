This video will give you an overview of the Data Warehouse Reporting lesson of the Build a Data Warehouse module. In this assignment, you will perform a couple of exercises. The first exercise requires you to load the data provided by the company into the tables in CSV format by performing a series of tasks. You will start by downloading the data from the links provided, and then load that data into the Dim Date table, Dim Category table, Dim Country table, and Fact table, Fact Sales. And after loading the data, you will take a screenshot of the first five rows in each table and name the screenshot. In the second exercise, you will query the loaded data by creating a grouping sets query, roll-up query, and cube query using the columns Order ID, Category, and Price Collected. Finally, you will create a materialized query table, or MQT, named Total Sales per Country using the Country and Total Sales columns. 
After performing each task, you will take a screenshot of the SQL and the output rows and then name the screenshot. Good luck, and let's get started.
