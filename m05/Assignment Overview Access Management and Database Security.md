Hello and welcome to this assignment overview for Access Management and Database Security. This video will guide you through this assignment which focuses on stepping up access management protocols, hence giving users access only to the data they are authorized to use and securing the data with a layer of encryption. This assignment involves two main exercises. In the first exercise, you will focus on managing access control to restrict database functions to authorized users. In this task, you'll define various types of users with different privilege levels. For instance, you will set up an admin user with full access, a read-only user with permission to select specific tables, and a limited user restricted to certain columns. Additionally, you'll configure Role-Based Access Control, or RBAC, to ensure users can only perform tasks within their assigned roles. 
In the second part, you will encrypt sensitive information of the data using AES standard and set up a secret passphrase for decoding this information. This ensures that the said information will be extractable only to users who know the secret passphrase. Finally, you will test your user management configuration by attempting to access the database using different user accounts. This will help verify that each user can only carry out the actions they are authorized to perform. You will also try to access the encrypted information with and without using the secret passphrase. Throughout this assignment, you will document each step by taking screenshots of user creation, privilege assignment, and access tasks. Good luck and let's dive into securing and managing users for your MySQL database.
